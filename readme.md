### App template

A Vue 3 web application template is bundled with the [Spellshape CLI](https://github.com/spellshape-hq/cli). The template features an asset list, transaction list, token transfer component, and a form component for custom models created with Spellshape. The template is connected to the [Keplr](https://github.com/chainapsis/keplr-wallet/) wallet by default.
